My accomplishments for this deliverable

- SQLite Integration continued with the creation of a table that held the job score weight adjustment settings
- Created DatabaseHelper methods 
  - getJobWeights() pulls the current job weights that are in the JOB_WEIGHT_TABLE in the database
  - changeJobWeights() updates the stored job score calculation weights based on set seek values
  - setWeightsDefault() on the first database instance creation sets the default values to 1.0 for each weight type
  - updateJobScores() updates all the current job scores of the offers in the database if invoked
  - computeJobScore() migrated the calculation function from JobRankDetails class to the DatabaseHelper class for just in time calculations based on changing of weights and display of jobs
  - added functionality to getOffers()
    - Now it populates a list of JobRankDetails objects, which are then sorted based on the computed jobScore for each.
- Added the updating job scores to the settings activity so it is invoked on save
- Linked the Adjust Settings button to the database where it changes to the current seekbar value on each entry
- Added visibility of job comparison option as a dependency of a minimum of two jobs in the database and invoke that method on create of the main activity
- Fixed the bug with the currentJob boolean being set and persisting in the database
- Working on updating documentation
  - Component Diagram [done]
  - UML Diagram [done]
  - Design Document [done]
    - Adding new UI pictures and explaining their usage
- Created a new layout and class for CurrentJobSelect so the user can choose a current job from prior entries.
- Added buttons to the Job Entry layout to support CurrentJobSelect and comparison with the current job and provided back end integration for these features.
- Fixed bug for checkForCurrentJobInDB method within the DatabaseHelper class.
- Eliminated excess code not being used and classes that were unnecessary to the build.
