## 1 Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions

The software is assumed to be used by employed users who mainly range between ages 18-65. Design has to be inclusive to a large age population. The software depends on users having access to an android-applicable device. The software does not depend on internet connection or cellular data. One assumption of the software is that it will have the fully functional features that are required of it. 

### 1.2 Constraints

- Platform - The system is limited in the platforms it can be on. The software will be developed in Android Studio, and be meant for android applicable devices.
- User - The user can only have one current job, reflecting the real world scenario. 
- Features - The application, as per the design, only has 4 features (edit or enter current job, enter job offers, change comparison settings, compare job offers).


### 1.3 System Environment

The system has to be run on hardware that runs on the Android OS. Specifically, the minimum API level is Android 11.0.

## 2 Architectural Design

*The architecture provides the high-level design view of a system and provides a basis for more detailed design work. These subsections describe the top-level components of the system you are building and their relationships.*

### 2.1 Component Diagram

*This section should provide and describe a diagram that shows the various components and how they are connected. This diagram shows the logical/functional components of the system, where each component represents a cluster of related functionality. In the case of simple systems, where there is a single component, this diagram may be unnecessary; in these cases, simply state so and concisely state why.*

### 2.2 Deployment Diagram

*This section should describe how the different components will be deployed on actual hardware devices. Similar to the previous subsection, this diagram may be unnecessary for simple systems; in these cases, simply state so and concisely state why.*

## 3 Low-Level Design

*Describe the low-level design for each of the system components identified in the previous section. For each component, you should provide details in the following UML diagrams to show its internal structure.*

### 3.1 Class Diagram

*In the case of an OO design, the internal structure of a software component would typically be expressed as a UML class diagram that represents the static class structure for the component and their relationships.*

### 3.2 Other Diagrams

*<u>Optionally</u>, you can decide to describe some dynamic aspects of your system using one or more behavioral diagrams, such as sequence and state diagrams.*

## 4 User Interface Design
*For GUI-based systems, this section should provide the specific format/layout of the user interface of the system (e.g., in the form of graphical mockups).*
